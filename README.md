disrupt-to-bullshit
===================

A browser extension which converts various forms of the word "disrupt" on every web page to various forms of the word "bullshit".

Inspired by the [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) plugin, as well as [cloud-to-butt-plus](https://github.com/hank/cloud-to-butt).

If you have both cloud-to-butt and disrupt-to-bullshit installed, I highly recommend [this webpage](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2014/01/05/why-the-cloud-just-might-be-the-most-disruptive-technology-ever/).

Note: this extension is not a comment on any particular company or management theory. (For that, see [here](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/06/23/140623fa_fact_lepore?currentPage=all) and [here](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-20/clayton-christensen-responds-to-new-yorker-takedown-of-disruptive-innovation).) Rather, disrupt-to-bullshit is offered for the entertainment of those who wish to install it in the privacy of their own browser, in the hope that they may be able to take full advantage of the comedic opportunities afforded to us by the current public over-saturation of the word 'disrupt.'
