disrupt-to-bullshit
===================

A browser extension which converts various forms of the word "disrupt" to various forms of the word "bullshit" in all web pages.

Inspired by the [Cloud To Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) plugin, as well as [Cloud To Butt Plus](https://github.com/hank/cloud-to-butt).

If you have both Cloud To Butt Plus and Disrupt To Bullshit installed, I highly recommend [this webpage](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2014/01/05/why-the-cloud-just-might-be-the-most-disruptive-technology-ever/).

Note: Disrupt to Bullshit is not a commentary on any particular company or management theory. (For both sides of the debate over the latter, see [here](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/06/23/140623fa_fact_lepore?currentPage=all) and [here](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-20/clayton-christensen-responds-to-new-yorker-takedown-of-disruptive-innovation).) Rather, Disrupt to Bullshit is offered for the entertainment of those who wish to install it in the privacy of their own browser, in the hope that they may be able to take full advantage of the comedic opportunities afforded to us all by the current public over-saturation of the word 'disrupt.'
