Disrupt to Bullshit
===================

A browser extension which converts various forms of the word "disrupt" to various forms of the word "bullshit," in all web pages.

Inspired by the [Cloud To Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) plugin, as well as [Cloud To Butt Plus](https://github.com/hank/cloud-to-butt).

Note: Disrupt to Bullshit is not a commentary on any particular company or any particular theory of business cycles. (For both sides of the debate over the latter, see [here](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/06/23/140623fa_fact_lepore?currentPage=all) and [here](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-20/clayton-christensen-responds-to-new-yorker-takedown-of-disruptive-innovation).) Rather, Disrupt to Bullshit is offered for the entertainment of those who wish to install it in the privacy of their own browser, in the hope that they may be able to take full advantage of the comedic opportunities afforded to us all by the current public over-saturation of the word 'disrupt.'

### Installation

**[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disrupt-to-bullshit/mahaemfhlcjficbbkbpmkbhhenfnikcf)**   
**[Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disrupt-to-bullshit/)**  
**Safari extension** (anybody want to make this one?)  
**Opera add-on** (they say the Chrome extension is compatible with Opera)  
**Internet Explorer add-on** (I'm looking into it. It looks pretty hairy, though. It's probably not going to happen)

Alternatively, to play around with the code yourself in Chrome:

1. Clone this repo
2. In Chrome, go to chrome://extensions
3. Click on "Developer mode"
4. Click on "Load unpacked extension..."
5. Navigate to your local copy of this repo, and select the 'sources' folder

### A note on the code

The code in the sources directory can be used to make a Chrome extension. Firefox add-ons are not significantly different, but currently I create new versions of the Firefox add-on by shifting a few things around manually. In the future, there will be a build step to create both versions.
