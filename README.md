disrupt-to-bullshit
===================

A browser extension which converts various forms of the word "disrupt" on every web page to various forms of the word "bullshit".

Inspired by two sources:

1) The [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/hank/cloud-to-butt) plugin

2) [The Disruption Machine](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/06/23/140623fa_fact_lepore), an article by Jill Lepore in the June 23, 2014, issue of the New Yorker.

If you have both cloud-to-butt and disrupt-to-bullshit installed, I highly recommend [this webpage](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2014/01/05/why-the-cloud-just-might-be-the-most-disruptive-technology-ever/).
a browser extension which changes 'disrupt' to 'bullshit'. Inspired by cloud-to-butt.


Installation
------------

Right now you have to download this into a folder, go to chrome://extensions, click on Developer Mode, and click on Load Unpacked Extensions, then navigate to the folder where you put all the extension files.

Soon I'll have a packaged plugin, and soon after that I'll have ones for Firefox and Safari.
